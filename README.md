# Introduction

In the following folders you will find my solutions to the Advent of Code problems all written in Javascript.

# Installing Dependencies

I tried as much as possible to write up solutions without using external sources, but in some cases could not avoid it. In the case that there is a package.json/package-lock.json file just run the following:

```js
npm install
```

# Running the Code

After handling the dependencies (if any) just run the following:

```js
node "Part i"
```

where i can be either 1 or 2.
